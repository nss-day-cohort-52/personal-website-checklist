# Creating Your Personal Website
This is another way to introduce yourself and show off your skills and projects. It will need to be deployed. The easiest way to do that is with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Your personal site should include these sections:
* About Me - short paragraph about yourself
* Projects - Links to github repo and/or deployed site and short description of each project you've worked on
* Tech stack - can be img's of tech logos that you've worked with during NSS
* Contact - Links to your LinkedIn, Github, and if you're comfortable, your email address

## To use a template or not to use a template, that is the question
Do you want to highlight your css skills? Then do not use a template. Make a simple react app, doesn't need to have routing, that shows off your styling and ux skills.

Otherwise, it's acceptable to use a template for this. Most students choose one from [HTML5 Up](https://html5up.net/)
